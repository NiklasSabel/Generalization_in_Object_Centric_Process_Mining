Generalization in Object-Centric Process Mining
==============================

This repository includes the masterthesis of Niklas Sabel, written at the University of Mannheim in 2023. I try to adjust the quality dimension generalization for traditional process mining to the environment of object-centric process mining.


--------

After installing the given requirements file (pip install -r requirements.txt
), one can easily run the code included in the jupyter notebooks.

Sometimes, our experiments needed to be conducted on the servers of the bwHPC cluster in Karlsruhe due to capacity limits.
At the beginning of each notebook there is an indicator if some code from this notebook has been run there.
